## What's this repository for?

This repository is a list of publications whose call-for-papers (CFPs) appear in researchers' inbox even if they are never expected.

This repository does not hold any opinion about the listed journals/conferences, authors and their papers per se. Instead, it is just **a gentle reminder** to the **organizers**, that:

1. Your CFP emails offered no option to unsubscribe themselves, and/or
2. Your CFP emails did have the "unsubscribe" link, but it simply wouldn't work, and follow-up emails came as if nothing had happened, and/or
3. Whoever broadcasted the message (say, your cooperator who is responsible for advertisement) was using information gathered without the permission of the addresses' owners.

Until the organizers figure out what is going on and take pragmatic measures to improve the situation, we **researchers** have to choice but **create filters based on these key words**.
